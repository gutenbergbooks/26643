<center><h1>THE WORK OF CHRIST</h1></center>

<p>THE Word of God reveals, that all things were created by and for the
Son of God. &#8220;All things were made by Him and without Him was not
anything made that was made&#8221; (John i:3). &#8220;For by Him were all
things created that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and
invisible, whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or
powers; all things were created by Him and for Him&#8221; (Col. i:16).
When this perfect creation was ruined by the entrance of sin, when man
fell and all creation on account of that fall was brought into the
bondage of corruption, the work of redemption became a necessity. No
creature of God was fitted or fit to do this. Only the Son of God, the
Creator Himself, could undertake this mighty work and accomplish it to
the Praise and Glory of God. To do this great work, He had to appear on
this earth in the form of man.</p>

<center><h3><b>A Threefold Aspect.</b></h3></center>

<p>This work of the Son of God has a threefold aspect. It is a past
work, a present work, and beyond the present, there is His future work.
His work and service will terminate when He delivers up the kingdom, so
that God will be all in all (1 Cor. xv:24-28). This threefold aspect of
His work corresponds to His threefold office as Prophet, Priest and
King. It has a special meaning for the church. In Ephesians v:25-27, we
read of this. He loved the church and gave Himself for it; this is His
past work. Since then He is sanctifying the church by the washing of
water by the Word, and in the future He will present it to Himself, a
glorious church. In virtue of this threefold work of our Lord, believers
are saved, are being saved, and will be saved. This threefold work has
also a significance for the people Israel. When He came and went to the
cross, &#8220;He died for that nation&#8221; (John xi:42). During the
present age His earthly people are not cast away; their miraculous
preservation on earth, their continued, separate existence is due to
Himself. In the future when He appears as their Redeemer and claims the
purchased possession, He will turn away ungodliness from Jacob. And to
this we might also add the relation of His work to creation itself, the
nations of the earth, and to Satan and his rule.</p>

<p>These brief remarks show the importance of distinguishing between
this threefold aspect of His work. A Christian who is ignorant of it
must be confused in his conception of the truth. He is unable to
understand the Word of God, and is unsettled, and even miserable in his
Christian experience. Such, alas! is the present condition of a large
number of professing Christians. Many are ignorant of what the finished
work of Christ on the cross means. On account of this ignorance, they
are ever trying to do what God has done for them. How many more are at
sea about their position in Christ, and know next to nothing of the
priestly work of Christ. The confusion is the greatest in respect to His
future work as King. Our theme is therefore an important one. But even
God&#8217;s people, who in a measure have laid hold of these truths, need
constantly to be reminded of it and need to have all this through the
Spirit&#8217;s power, as a greater reality in their lives.</p><br><br>

<a name="past"></a>
<center><h3><b>I.<br>
HIS PAST WORK.</b></h3></center>

<p>His past work was accomplished by Him when he became incarnate. It
was finished when He died on Calvary&#8217;s cross. We have therefore to
consider first of all these fundamentals of our faith.</p>

<p><b>I. The Work of the Son of God is foreshadowed and predicted in the
Old Testament Scriptures.</b></p>

<p><b>II. The incarnation of the Son of God.</b></p>

<p><b>III. His Work on the cross and what has been accomplished by
it.</b></p>

<center><h3><b>I.</b></h3></center>

<p>Through the Old Testament Scriptures, God announced beforehand the
work of His Son. This is a great theme and one which needs to be
emphasized. These foreshadowings and predictions were made in different
ways. First we might mention the appearance from time to time on earth
of a supernatural Being. This Being was the Son of God. As soon as sin
had entered, He appeared on the scene seeking those who were lost. He
Himself announced the promise, that the seed of the woman should bruise
the serpent&#8217;s head. He indicated in Genesis iii:15, His
incarnation, His redemptive work on the cross and His final victory over
the enemy of God. Then He covered the nakedness of His creatures by
making them coats of skin. For the first time in the Word of God, it was
made known by this act what the blessed fruit of His atoning work would
be.</p>

<center><h3><b>Manifestations of Jehovah.</b></h3></center>

<p>And the same Jehovah appeared in visible form unto Abraham. He came
as traveller accompanied by two angels. He ate in the presence of
Abraham, who worshipped and addressed Him as Lord. This Being was none
other than the Son of God, the same who after His resurrection appeared
to the two disciples on their way to Emmaus as a traveller, and who, at
another occasion, ate of a honeycomb and a piece of fish. In His
presence Abraham interceded. This Lord, who visited Abraham later, made
fire and brimstone fall from heaven upon Sodom and Gomorrah; He executed
judgment. He appeared unto Jacob and was the mysterious man who wrestled
with him at Peniel; later Jacob called Him &#8220;The Angel, the
Redeemer.&#8221; Repeatedly we hear of Him as &#8220;The Angel of the
Lord,&#8221; not a created angel, but an uncreated Being. Moses saw Him
in the burning bush, and heard His voice. And while He is spoken of as
the angel of the Lord, He revealed Himself as Jehovah and made this Name
known to Moses. He was with Israel in the wilderness and dwelled with
them in the Glory cloud. He guided them, supplied their need, protected
them, judged them and overthrew their enemies. To Joshua He appeared and
manifested Himself as &#8220;The captain over the Lord&#8217;s
hosts.&#8221; Manoah and his wife saw Him, and witnessed His ascension
into heaven, in the smoke and fire of the sacrifice. Isaiah, Ezekiel and
Daniel gazed upon His Glory. All these were but foreshadowings and
glimpses of the two great manifestations of the Son of God on earth, as
they are necessitated by His work, His manifestation in humiliation and
His manifestation in power and glory.</p>

<center><h3><b>Other Foreshadowings of His Work.</b></h3></center>

<p>But there are other foreshadowings of His work. All the divinely
given institutions and many of the historical events recorded in the Old
Testament foreshadow His work. History, as recorded in the Old
Testament, is the preliminary history of the incarnation. The whole
sacrificial system of the levitical priesthood told out beforehand, in
many ways, what the great redemptive work of the Lamb of God was to be.
Each offering and sacrifice revealed the different phases of His work on
the cross, as well as His holy and spotless humanity. The sufferings of
Christ and their meaning for lost sinners were thus made known. From
Abel&#8217;s lamb to the last lamb, which died before the true Lamb of
God uttered the never to be forgotten words on the cross, &#8220;It is
finished,&#8221; the thousands of lambs and bulls and goats, the
innumerable herds of animals slain, were all types of the one great
sacrifice, brought on Calvary&#8217;s cross. The tabernacle in all its
appointments, down to the minutest details, had I some meaning in
connection with the Person of Him who is &#8220;Wonderful&#8221; and His
wonderful work. And what else could we say of the historical events,
such as the Passover, the passage through the Red Sea, the brazen
serpent hung up in the wilderness. And to this we might add how men in
their experiences, like Isaac, Joseph, David and others foreshadowed the
sufferings of Christ and the glory that should follow.</p>

<center><h3><b>Direct Prophecies.</b></h3></center>

<p>Still more numerous are the direct prophecies announcing the
different phases of the work of Christ. That He should appear as man,
how and where He should be born, His life, His service, His miracles,
all was repeatedly foretold by the Prophets. But the great mass of
predictions concern His sufferings as the sin-bearer and His glories as
the King. None of the details of His sufferings were omitted. Think, for
instance, of the predictions contained in the xxii Psalm. Death by
crucifixion was unknown among the Jewish people. No nation in touch with
Israel, living at that time, put human beings to death in that way. It
was reserved for cruel Rome to invent death; by crucifixion. Yet in this
Psalm there is given by divine inspiration a complete picture of that
unknown mode of death by crucifixion. We read of His hands and feet
pierced, the bones out of joint, the excessive thirst, the tongue
cleaving to the jaws. And so we find His resurrection, His presence with
God, His coming again and His Kingdom of Righteousness and Glory
foretold in the Prophets.</p>

<center><h3><b>The Inspiration of the Old Testament.</b></h3></center>

<p>We emphasize these facts of divine foreshadowing and prediction,
because in these last days thousands of men have arisen throughout
Christendom who boldly deny the inspiration of the Old Testament. They
would have us believe that all these wonderful predictions are of human
origin. They brand nearly everything as legend, and declare that there
are no Messianic predictions in the Bible, that God did not speak to the
Prophets concerning His Son and His work. Such a denial of the
revelation of God in the Old Testament Scriptures is but the vanguard of
the denial of the Son of God and His work. &#8220;Denying the Master that
bought them&#8221; (2 Peter ii:1), is the leading phase of apostate
Christendom in the last days. It is Anti-christianity. This denial is
preceded by a denial of the written Word of God. The higher criticism,
so called, is Satan&#8217;s leaven which leavens the theological
institutions of Christendom and is fully preparing an empty Christian
profession for the reception of the Man of Sin. To believe that these
marvelous, harmonious predictions and fore-shadowings contained in the
Old Testament are the productions of clever men, legends put together by
evil men, who claimed to have received them from God, is far more
difficult than to believe that they are given by divine revelation.</p>

<center><h3><b>II.<br> The Incarnation of the Son of
God.</b></h3></center>

<p>And now let us turn to the great truth and fact of the Incarnation of
the Son of God. When the fulness of time had come, that is the appointed
time, the Son of God appeared on earth in the form of man. The Word
which was in the beginning, the Word that was with the Father, the Word
that was God, the Word by whom all things were made, that Word was made
flesh and dwelt on earth. He who subsisted in the form of God, emptied
Himself and took upon Himself the form of a servant, and was made in the
likeness of men.</p>

<p> The incarnation is a deep mystery, the depths of which human reason
can never fathom. We must approach it in the spirit of deep reverence.
&#8220;Take off thy shoes from thy feet for the ground whereon thou
standest is holy ground!&#8221; In the first chapter of the Gospel of
Luke, we have the record of the divine announcement of the incarnation
as it was made to the virgin, who had found favor in the sight of God.
As she sat in the house, perhaps engaged in holy meditation, the angel
Gabriel appeared unto her with the message from the throne of God. Was
there ever such a message given to Gabriel before? Great as the
revelation was which he was commissioned to carry to praying Daniel, the
communication to the Virgin Mary here is far greater.</p>

<center><h3><b>The Incarnation Announced.</b></h3></center>

<p>We read in Luke i:35: &#8220;And the angel of the Lord said unto her,
The Holy Spirit shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall
overshadow thee; therefore also that Holy Thing, which shall be born of
thee, shall be called the Son of God.&#8221; Let us notice the two great
statements given about His incarnation. &#8220;The Holy Spirit shall come
upon thee.&#8221; From the Gospel of Matthew we learn the full meaning of
this statement. &#8220;That which is begotten in her is of the Holy
Ghost.&#8221; Therefore His human nature was produced in the virgin by
the creative action of the Holy Spirit. Because His human nature was
thus produced, it was a nature without sin; not only did He not sin, but
He could not sin. He was sinless, absolutely holy, because He was
conceived by the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>The second statement is: &#8220;And the power of the Highest shall
overshadow thee.&#8221; This is not a repetition of the same truth as
contained in the first statement. If this too would mean the Holy
Spirit, we would have to conclude that the Holy Spirit is the Father of
Him who became incarnate. We read at once after this second statement,
&#8220;Therefore that Holy Thing, which shall be born of thee, shall be
called the Son of God.&#8221; The power of the Highest does not mean the
power of the Holy Spirit. It is none other than the Son of God Himself.
The eternal Son of God, He who is God, overshadowed her and this
overshadowing meant the union of Himself with the human nature created
by the Holy Spirit in the Virgin Mary.</p>

<p>He is called &#8220;that Holy Thing.&#8221; He is something entirely
new, a Being which cannot be classified. And then we read again,
&#8220;That Holy Thing shall be called the Son of God.&#8221; It does not
say &#8220;shall be the Son of God;&#8221; such He ever was. Incarnation
did not make Him Son of God. He shall be called Son of God; God
manifested in the flesh.</p>

<p>Much time could be spent in adding to these remarks, or in reviewing
the different attempts which have been made to explain the great
mystery. We might also enumerate all the evil teachings and theories
which are the results of attempted explanations. But all this would be
but waste of time. No human mind can fathom the depths of the
incarnation, nor fully grasp the wonderful personality of the God-Man,
the Lord Jesus Christ. Far better it is to abide by these simple
declarations of the Word of God, than to enter into speculations, which
can never solve this great mystery.</p>

<p>A certain American statesman was once asked, &#8220;Can you comprehend
how Jesus Christ could be both God and Man?&#8221; The great thinker
replied, &#8220;No, sir; I cannot. And I would be ashamed to acknowledge
Him as my Saviour if I could, for then He would not be greater than
myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>This is very true indeed. With joyful and grateful hearts we believe
the great revelation given to us in God&#8217;s holy Word, that God so
loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son and that the Son of
God left Heaven&#8217;s Glory and came to this earth. He emptied Himself
and appeared in the form of the creature. This, however, does not mean
what an evil theory, by the name of &#8220;Kenosis,&#8221; teaches, that
He emptied Himself of His Godhead. He emptied Himself of His outward
Glory. The child which rested on the bosom of Mary is the One, who ever
was in the bosom of the Father. Listen once more to the language of the
xxii Psalm. &#8220;I was cast upon thee from the womb; Thou art my God
from my mother&#8217;s belly. Thou didst make me hope when I was upon my
mother&#8217;s breasts.&#8221; What mere human child could have ever said
this truthfully? Nor is this the language of a poet. The child born in
Bethlehem alone could speak thus.</p>

<center><h3><b>The Foundation of the Gospel.</b></h3></center>

<p>The incarnation is the great foundation of the whole Gospel. No
incarnation means no Gospel, no Hope and no God. The person who denies
this truth has no right whatever to the name of Christian. At no time
has the denial of this great foundation truth been so pronounced and
widespread as in our times. Men believing themselves wise, in possession
of greater knowledge than former generations, turn their backs upon
revelation. The miracle, including the incarnation, is denied. And this
denial is not from the side of outspoken infidels alone, but those who
profess to be teachers of Christianity are the foremost leaders in it.
We mention Reginald Campbell and his followers in the so-called
&#8220;New Theology.&#8221; And the hundreds of evangelical preachers, who
wished this man Godspeed during his recent visit to America, who passed
resolutions of thanks, after listening to his subtle infidelity, are, in
the light of 2 John 10, partakers of his sin. And then there is that
Anti-christian system, known by the name of Christian Science. In its
so-called philosophical, in reality, satanic utterances, it opposes the
revelation of God and denies that Jesus Christ is come into the flesh.
That evil book, &#8220;Science and Health,&#8221; to which we readily
accord inspiration, not from above, but from below, teaches &#8220;The
Virgin Mary conceived the idea of God and gave to her ideal the name of
Jesus;&#8221; and again &#8220;Jesus was the offspring of Mary&#8217;s
self-communion with God.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is a comfort to believers in these evil days to remember, that
such a rejection of the doctrine of Christ, His Person and His work, is
predicted in the Bible to take place immediately before the Lord comes.
The end of the age is upon us. These denials will not decrease, but
become more numerous.</p>

<center><h3><b>The Purpose of the Incarnation.</b></h3></center>

<p>And what was the purpose of the incarnation? By incarnation the
invisible God was made known to man. The Lord Jesus Christ is the image
of the invisible God. No man hath seen God at any time, the only
Begotten, who is in the bosom of the Father, hath declared Him. As One
with the Father, the Lord Jesus Christ could say, &#8220;Whosoever seeth
Me, seeth the Father.&#8221;</p>

<p>The attributes of God were made known by Him in incarnation. We
behold the holiness of God in that holy life, which was lived on earth
to glorify the Father. He manifested omniscience. He knew what was in
men and knew their thoughts. He manifested the power of God in
controlling the forces of nature, commanding the wind and the waves,
turning water into wine. He had power over disease, over the demons and
over death. He revealed the Love and the compassion of God.</p>

<p>By incarnation the Son of God brought likewise the Word of God to
man. &#8220;God who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time
past unto the Fathers by the Prophets, hath in these last days spoken
unto us by His Son&#8221; (Hebrews i:1). He confirmed the Law and the
Prophets, therefore all criticism of the Old Testament attacks the
authority and infallibility of the Son of God. He also revealed the will
of God, made known the Father and the fact of eternal life, and the
eternal and conscious punishment of the wicked. He predicted the great
future events concerning Himself and His Kingdom, the end of the age and
His visible Return.</p>

<p>The incarnation was necessary in anticipation of His work as the
Priest of His people. He was to be after His death on the cross and
after resurrection, the merciful and faithful High Priest. Such He is
now. He took part of flesh and blood, we read in the second chapter of
Hebrews, that He might be a merciful and faithful High Priest. He was
tempted in all things as we are, with the exception of sin. He suffered
in being tempted so that He might be touched with the feeling of our
infirmities and succour them that are tempted. And all He was to be and
is now, the Second Man, the last Adam, the head of the church, the head
of the new creation, all and much else necessitated His incarnation.</p>

<center><h3><b>What Incarnation could not Accomplish.</b></h3></center>

<p>However, the great purpose of the incarnation of the Son of God was
His work of redemption. For this great purpose He came into the world.
He came that, after a life, which completely glorified the Father and
upheld His holy law and vindicated God&#8217;s rights as the lawgiver, He
might accomplish the great work of atonement. John stated this great
work the Son of God came to do in a brief sentence, &#8220;Behold the
Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.&#8221; Sin, that
accursed thing, had to be taken out of the way. Propitiation for sins
had to be made. A sacrifice had to be brought which would glorify a holy
God and satisfy, as well as exalt, His righteousness. Peace had to be
made. The sins of many had to be paid and the full penalty of them to be
borne.</p>

<p>Incarnation in itself, the marvelous and ever blessed humiliation of
the Son of God by taking on the human form, His holy blessed life, His
loving words, words of life and peace, yea, all He did in deeds of love
and compassion could never accomplish this. Incarnation brought God to
Man, but could never bring man back to a holy God. Incarnation could not
make an end of sin, nor make it possible for a righteous God to show
mercy to the fallen and the lost, in a righteous way. This great work of
redemption could only be accomplished by His death on the cross. For
this He had come. He came to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself.
The Author and Prince of Life came that He might give His Life a ransom
for many. The good Shepherd appeared to give His life for the sheep. By
His death alone, the great work of redemption could be accomplished.</p>

<center><h3><b>III.<br> His work on the Cross and What has been
Accomplished by It.</b></h3></center>

<p>And now let us consider His work on the cross and what has been
accomplished by it. But who is able to speak worthily of this theme of
all themes? Who can fathom the solemn yet blessed fact, the death of the
Son of God on the cross? What tongue or pen can describe the sad, yet
glorious truth, that the Just One died for the unjust, that Christ died
for the ungodly! He who knew no sin was made sin for us! And what human
mind can estimate the wonderful results of His work on the cross!</p>

<p>Some Christians speak as if the death on the cross, the work
accomplished there, is so fully known to them, that they do not need any
more instruction on it. They tell us that they search for deeper things.
There can be nothing deeper than the death of God&#8217;s Son on the
cross. Depths are here which are unfathomable. We must ever turn back to
the cross. Always we shall learn something new. With unspeakable Glory
upon us and greater glory before us in eternal ages to come, the cross
of Christ and the Lamb of God which has taken away the sin of the world
can never be forgotten. But we shall never know what that death on the
cross meant for Him and what it meant to God.</p>

<center><h3><b>Made Sin for Us.</b></h3></center>

<p>In Hebrews x we read of the sacrifices which were offered by the Jews
year after year. These sacrifices could not take away sin. Then He, the
Son of God, stepped forward and made His great declaration. Coming into
the world He saith, &#8220;Sacrifice and offering Thou wouldest not, but
a body hast Thou prepared me. In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sins
Thou hadst no pleasure&#8221; (verses 4-5). The body prepared puts before
us again the fact of incarnation. That body was a prepared body, a holy
body, an undefiled body, a body in which sin could not dwell and on
which death had no claim. But when He took on that body, He likewise
said: &#8220;Lo? come to do Thy will, O God.&#8221; In the tenth verse we
read, &#8220;By the which will (the will of God, which dates back before
the foundation of the world), we are sanctified through the offering of
the body of Jesus Christ once for all.&#8221; Through the eternal Spirit
He offered Himself without spot to God. The holy Lamb of God, with no
spot or blemish upon Him, shed His precious blood on the cross, to
procure redemption. But what it all meant for Him who was as truly Man
as He is God! Here was a Being perfectly holy, One who had always
pleased God and did His will, yea, His meat and drink was to do the will
of Him that sent Him. Sin was the horrible defiling thing to Him. He,
too, like the holy God, hated and hates sin. And yet such a One was made
sin for us. He had to stand in the place of guilty sinners and all the
waves and billowy of divine judgment and wrath had to pass over Him. He
drank the cup of wrath to the last drop. He suffered in a fourfold
way.</p>

<p>1. <b>In Himself.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Before He ever approached the
garden of Gethsemane, He was troubled in His spirit. We hear Him say,
&#8220;Now my soul is troubled&#8212;Father, save me from this hour, but
for this cause came I to this hour.&#8221; He looked on towards the
cross. And why that agony in the garden? Why was His sweat as it were
great drops of blood? Why the repeated prayer, &#8220;Father, if it is
possible, let this cup pass from me?&#8221; How many dishonoring
explanations have been written of the Gethsemane suffering, as if He was
afraid to die or that the devil tried to kill Him there to prevent his
death on the cross, and that He feared the devil. But what was it? He
suffered in Himself. His holy soul shrank from that which a holy God must
hate, that which He hated&#8212;SIN. He was about to be made sin and He
knew no sin. What suffering this produced in the Holy One of God to take
all upon Himself and to stand in the sinner&#8217;s place before a holy
sin-hating God, our poor finite minds cannot realize.</p>

<p>2. <b>He suffered from men.</b>&nbsp; This he had foretold. When man,
guilty man, cast Himself upon the willing victim, all the wickedness and
vileness and cruelty man is capable of committing was brought out and
spent upon the blessed Son of God. The scourging, the buffeting, the
mocking, the spitting and the shame connected with it, the shame of the
cross, He despised. How that sensitive body must have quivered under it
all!</p>

<p>3. <b>He suffered from the devil.</b>&nbsp; He had tempted him.
Nothing was left undone, what this wonderful Being could do. All His
cunning and powers were brought into use, with the one purpose to keep
Him from going to the cross and dying in the sinner&#8217;s place. And
when at last he could not keep Him from going to the cross, then he cast
himself upon the victim and heaped all his hatred and malice upon Him.
He used man in all this awful work and no doubt the legions of demons.
And in all this the Son of God was as a lamb, which is dumb before the
shearers. He opened not His mouth.</p>

<p>4. <b>But the greatest of all, He suffered from God.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
With hushed breath, we must speak of this. It is the Holy of Holies of
the great work on the cross, the impenetrable mystery of the atoning
work of the Son of God. From the darkness which enshrouded the cross and
the blessed sufferer on the accursed tree, there came the mournful cry:
&#8220;My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken me?&#8221; It made known the
awful suffering, which the Lamb of God, the substitute of sinners,
endured from the hand of a holy God. He was smitten and afflicted of
God. Have you noticed that in the xxii Psalm this cry of the sufferer on
the cross stands first? Man would have written the sufferings of Christ
in a far different way. The descriptions of the sufferings not written
by inspiration would have been in this wise: The physical sufferings,
how they scourged Him, all the sickening details of that which even
cruel Rome called the intermediate death, would have been pictured. Then
would have followed a description of how the nails were driven into the
blessed hands who had lovingly touched so many weary, sin-laden and
disease-stricken bodies. All the agony of the cross and its shame would
have been described first by man. Then how the multitude mocked and
darkness came over the entire scene&#8212;then last of all, it would have
been stated, He cried, My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken me? But
the Holy Spirit in this great Prophecy puts the cry of deepest agony
first. Why? Because in that hour the great work of atonement,
propitiation, sin-bearing, judgment and wrath enduring, was once and for
all accomplished. In this same Psalm we read what men energized by
Satan&#8217;s power, did unto Him. But man could not put Him to death. It
is written, &#8220;Thou (that is God) hast brought me into the dust of
death.&#8221; God&#8217;s own hand rested upon Him. &#8220;God laid upon
Him the iniquity of us all&#8221; (Isaiah liii:6). &#8220;It pleased the
Lord to bruise Him; He hath put Him to grief.&#8221; And elsewhere we
read, what refers to the same atoning work of our Lord when He stood in
the sinner&#8217;s place.</p>

<p>&#8220;All Thy waves and billows go over me&#8221; (Ps. xlii:7).</p>

<p>&#8220;Thine arrows stick fast in Me&#8221; (Ps. xxxviii:2).</p>

<p>&#8220;Thine hand presses me sore&#8221; (Ps. xxxviii:2).</p>

<p>&#8220;Thou hast laid me into the lowest pit&#8221; (Ps.
lxxxviii:6).</p>

<p>&#8220;Thy wrath lieth hard upon me&#8221; (Ps. lxxxviii:7).</p>

<p>&#8220;Thy fierce wrath goeth over me&#8221; (Ps. lxxxviii:16).</p>

<p>&#8220;I suffer Thy terrors&#8221; (Ps. lxxxviii:15).</p>

<p>But what it all meant for the Son of God! Who can tell out His sorrow
and deep affliction? Never shall we fully discover the greatness of the
price which was paid. The death of the cross, it has been truly said,
stands perfectly alone. It can never be repeated and because of its
eternal efficacy, will never need to be repeated.</p>

<center><h3><i>It is Finished.</i></h3></center>

<p>And this great work He came to do, is finished. &#8220;It is
finished!&#8221; thus He spoke on the cross and the words assure us that
all is done. The rent veil and the open tomb tell us &#8220;It is
finished.&#8221; But what has been accomplished in this blessed work? We
cannot fully grasp it now as long as we look into a glass darkly. When
at last we are brought into His Presence, transformed into His own
image, when we shall have share with Him in His glorious inheritance,
when at last sin and death are no more and a new heaven and new earth
are called into existence, then shall we more fully know what that work
has accomplished. All, ALL we have and are, all we shall have and shall
be as His own, has its blessed source in the cross of Christ.</p>

<p>He died for all. He gave Himself a ransom for all. He tasted death
for every man. He is the propitiation for the whole world (not for the
sins of the whole world, else the whole world would be saved). It means
His work is available to all sinners. Upon that fact that He died for
all, the Gospel is preached to lost and guilty sinners. Christ died for
the ungodly. &#8220;Whosoever will&#8221;&#8212;&#8220;Whosoever
believeth,&#8221; these are the precious conditions of the Gospel of
Grace which sounds forth from the finished work of Christ on the cross.
And all who believe on Him and accept the Lord Jesus Christ as their
Saviour, for them He bore their sins on the cross. Each believing sinner
can look back to the cross and can say, &#8220;He loved me, He gave
Himself for me.&#8221; He paid my debt. He bore my sins in His own body
on the tree. He stood in my place. He was my substitute. He tasted death
for me.</p>

<p>Much of the evil teachings of the present day, such as universal
salvation, larger hope, millennial dawnism, etc., emanate from the fact
that propitiation and substitution are not correctly understood.
Propitiation is the Godward side of the sacrifice of Christ, with this
God is satisfied. The propitiation is for the whole world. This does
not mean that the whole world is therefore to be saved. He bore the sins
of many&#8212;not the sins of all. He was the substitute on the cross
only for such who believe on Him.</p>

<p>And what do we possess who have believed on Him, own Him as our
Saviour and our Substitute? Many Scriptures might be read in answer to
this question. We cannot do so, but shall mention briefly a few things
which all believing sinners share on account of the finished work of
Christ on the cross.</p>

<p><b>We have a perfect justification.</b> All our sins are forever put
away, because they were borne and paid for by His death on the cross.
The Blood of Jesus Christ, His Son, cleanses us from all sin. All has
been righteously and forever settled. &#8220;Who shall bring any
accusation against God&#8217;s elect? It is God who justifies, who is he
that condemns? It is Christ who has died.&#8221; &#8220;There is therefore
now no condemnation to those in Christ Jesus.&#8221; <b>We have perfect
Peace with God.</b> Peace has been made in the blood of the cross. It
can never be unmade. We have peace with God through our Lord Jesus
Christ. He is our Peace. So many Christians think their peace with God
depends on their walk and service. If they sin, they think they have
lost their peace and their standing before God and unless they are
restored, they will be lost forever. Not our walk and service, not
anything we have done, we do or shall do, is the ground of peace with
God, but what God has done for us in Christ&#8217;s atoning on the
cross.</p>

<p>Then <b>we have a perfect acceptance and standing before God; perfect
nearness and access to God.</b> We are made nigh by the blood. With no
more conscience of sins, we can stand in God&#8217;s own presence, purged
and cleansed, complete in Him, as near to God as He is.</p>

<p>His blessed work on the cross has made an end of the old man. We are
dead to the world, to self, to sin, to the law. The old man was
crucified with Christ. &#8220;Sin shall have no more dominion over
you.&#8221; This is the blessed message from the cross. <b>We have
deliverance from the power of darkness and a perfect title to an eternal
inheritance.</b> No uncertainty is attached to all this. We have
salvation, are saved, forever secure, Sons of God, Heirs of God indwelt
by the Holy Spirit, and much else, on account of the finished work of
Christ on the cross.</p>

<p>And to all this we add that on the cross He loved the church and gave
Himself for it. There He died for Israel and as a result the remnant of
that people will some day be delivered from iniquity and perverse-ness,
as Balaam, beheld them, &#8220;no iniquity in Jacob and no perverseness
in Israel&#8221; (Numbers xxiii:21). Groaning creation will ultimately be
freed from the bondage of corruption and brought into the liberty of the
sons of God, because He shed His blood on the cross. All things in
heaven and on the earth (not things under the earth) will be reconciled
in virtue of the death of Christ on the cross.</p>

<center><h3><b>Ye are not Your Own.</b></h3></center>

<p>Let us remember as such who have been reconciled and have redemption
through His blood that we are bought with a price. &#8220;Ye are not your
own for ye are bought with a price, therefore glorify God in your body,
and in your spirit, which are God&#8217;s&#8221; (1 Cor. vi:20). Through
His death we are positionally dead; all who believe on Him have died. We
are dead to the law, to the world, to sin. But are we truly living,
walking and acting as such who have died, dead to sin and alive unto
God? A child of God who walks after the flesh practically denies the
power and value of the blessed finished work of Christ on the cross.</p>

<p>Let us exalt in our lives, by our words and deeds, the cross of
Christ. &#8220;But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of
our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I
unto the world&#8221; (Gal. vi:14).</p><br><br>

<a name="present"></a>
<center><h3><b>II.<br>
HIS PRESENT WORK.</b></h3></center>

<p>The great work which the Lord Jesus Christ, God&#8217;s well beloved
Son, came to do was to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself. This
finished work of the cross is the basis of His present work and His
future work. What mind can estimate the value and preciousness of that
work in which the Holy One offered Himself through the eternal Spirit
without spot unto God! He procured redemption by His death on the cross.
In His present work and much more in the future work, He works out this
great redemption into result.</p>

<p>There is much confusion in the minds of Christians about the present
and future work of Christ. Many speak of the Lord being now the King of
kings and Lord of lords, reigning over the earth. They speak of Him as
occupying the throne of His father David in heaven. The church,
according to this teaching, is His Kingdom, and that kingdom is
gradually being enlarged under His spiritual reign until the whole world
has been brought into this kingdom. All this is wrong. The Lord Jesus
Christ will reign over the earth; He will have a kingdom of glory, of
righteousness and peace on this earth; the nations of the earth will
have to submit to His government, but all this is still to come. It will
be accomplished with His visible Return to the earth, when He will claim
as the second Man the dominion of the earth. His kingly rule is future.
His present work is of another nature.</p>

<center><h3><b>I.<br> The Bodily Presence of Christ in
Glory.</b></h3></center>

<p>Our blessed Lord gave on the cross the body, which He had taken in
incarnation. That body died. It was the only part of Him, which could
die. But that body so dishonored by man, scourged and nailed to the
cross, could not see corruption. He arose from the dead. The mighty
power of God opened that grave and raised Him from the dead. This mighty
power of God, which brought Him forth is the power which is towards us
who believe. It is on our side (Eph. i:19). And God not alone raised Him
from the dead, but He gave Him glory (1 Peter i:21).</p>

<p>If I were to teach on the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ, I
would demonstrate two things. First, that He actually arose; the
indisputable fact, that He who had really died, who was dead bodily,
arose bodily, and, in the second place, the all important meaning of His
resurrection.</p>

<p>The Apostle Paul writes in that great chapter in First Corinthians,
&#8220;If Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your
sins. Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are
perished&#8221; (1 Cor. xv:18). In other words, if the Lord Jesus Christ
came not forth from the tomb, where His blessed body had been laid and
where it rested for three days, if He did not leave that grave in a
bodily form, His death on the cross would have no more meaning than the
death of any other human being. Then that blood which was shed could
never take away our sins and give the guilty conscience rest.
Furthermore, the countless beings, who passed out of this life trusting
in Christ, would have all perished. But Christ rose from the dead. There
can be no doubt about it. The witnesses for it are simply
unanswerable.</p>

<center><h3><b>His Physical Resurrection.</b></h3></center>

<p>His resurrection from the dead was God&#8217;s answer to His prayers
with strong crying and tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered prayers and
supplication with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save
him from death, and was heard in that he feared&#8221; (Heb. v:27).</p>

<p>This took place in Gethsemane. The answer to His prayers and tears
came from God on the morning of the first day. His resurrection from the
dead was the &#8220;Amen&#8221; of God to His triumphant shout on the
cross, &#8220;It is finished.&#8221; By raising Him from the dead, God set
His seal to the work of Christ on the cross. God gave His witness by it
that the work, which was demanded by His holiness and righteousness, had
been fully accomplished. Guilty man can now be righteously acquitted
from His guilt because God&#8217;s eternal righteousness was upheld and
satisfied by His own Son in that He paid the penalty.</p>

<p>Even before God rolled away the stone? He had shown that the work
done was pleasing to Him. It seemed as if God could not wait for the
third day. His hand took hold of the veil, which hid the Holy of Holies
from the eyes of man. He rent that veil from top to bottom. He showed
thereby that He, the Holy God, could now come forth in fullest blessing
to man, and man bought by such a price, can approach into the presence
of God and be at home with Him, a loving Father. Sinners saved by grace
can enter into the Holiest by the blood of Jesus, by the new and living
way.</p>

<p>And how did He come forth from the grave? It has already been stated.
He arose with the body He had taken on in incarnation, the body which
could not see corruption. He left the grave in a corporeal form. It was
not a phantom, but a tangible body. The nailprints were still seen in
His hands and in His feet. The side showed the place where the spear had
entered. He appeared in that body in the midst of His disciples and
showed unto them His hands and His side. And when at another time they
cried out for fear, He said, &#8220;Behold, my hands and my feet, that it
is myself; handle me and see, for a spirit has not flesh and bones, as
ye see me have&#8221; (Luke xxiv:39-40). And while they believed not for
joy, He proved His corporeality by eating a piece of broiled fish and of
a honeycomb. But while it was the same body it was also a glorified
body. Such a body, like unto His own glorious body, we shall receive
some blessed day in exchange for the body of humiliation; for this
redemption of the body we still wait as well as those who have fallen
asleep in Jesus.</p>

<center><h3><b>Passing through the Heavens.</b></h3></center>

<p>In this body He left the earth and passed through the heavens into
heaven itself. What a scene that must have been! What must have taken
place after He had been lifted up and disappeared out of sight from the
gazing disciples! They saw Him as He was lifted up, the same Lord Jesus,
until the glory cloud, the Shekinah, took Him up and in that cloud He
was taken into the heavens, where the physical eye could not follow.
What a triumphant entrance into the heavens it must have been! Perhaps
the mighty Archangel accompanied Him, the victor over Sin, Death, the
Grave and Satan; for the Archangel will accompany Him some day in His
descent out of heaven. The Lord went up with a shout (Psalm xlvii:5). He
will return with the victor&#8217;s shout. When He comes back, He will be
attended by the mighty angels. May not these heavenly hosts have been
present as He ascended on high? And as the Man Christ Jesus passed
upward through the territory, which is still the domain of Satan, the
prince of the power in the air, the wicked tenants of the air fell back
in fear and trembling. The glorified Man passed on, upward, higher and
higher. Nothing could arrest His progress. The mighty power of God
raised Him up. Through the second heaven He passed, where the wonderful
stars, the creation of His own power, describe their great orbits around
their fiery suns. He is still attended by angels, and the angelic hosts
beheld Him, who were also the witnesses of His sufferings, His death and
resurrection. At last a place was reached where every angel had to halt.
Even the Archangel had to cover His face and cry, &#8220;Holy!
Holy!&#8221; Yonder is the third heaven and there stands the glorious
throne of God. The glorified Man advances alone; He ascended on high
into the immediate presence of His God and our God, His Father and our
Father. The welcoming voice of God Himself bade Him to take His seat on
His own right hand until His enemies are made His footstool. What must
it have been when the only begotten Son returned to His eternal dwelling
place as the First begotten, and God as well as He himself beheld the
host of redeemed sinners brought by Him into that Glory!</p>

<p>The highest place was given to Him, who died on the cross, far above
all principality and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that
is named. There He is now the Man in the Glory. Once more let me state
it, the Lord Jesus Christ is corporeally present in the highest heaven.
Everything depends on this. If His physical resurrection and corporeal
presence in the highest heaven is denied, His present work and future
work are an impossibility, and we rob ourselves of every comfort, joy
and peace. Then, too, His atoning work on the cross has no meaning for
us.</p>

<center><h3><b>A Fundamental Truth Denied.</b></h3></center>

<p>And too often this great truth of the bodily presence of Christ in
heaven is denied in these days of departure from the faith. They teach,
His resurrection was a spiritual one, that He lives only by His words.
The denial of the literal resurrection of our blessed Lord and His
presence in heaven has become very widespread. Three evil systems
especially deny it.</p>

<p>1. <b>Unitarianism.</b> As a sect this denomination is small, but the
leaven of Unitarianism is leavening Christendom. All this criticism of
the Bible, the new theology, a more liberal religion, but all aiming at
the essential Deity of our blessed Lord, His incarnation and
resurrection from the dead, is the leaven of Unitarianism. At a recent
annual service of the British and Foreign Unitarian Association the
chairman observed that &#8220;earnest and thoughtful men, occupying
pulpits once dedicated to the propagation of doctrines strictly
orthodox, were now preaching a Gospel, which for liberality and
broadmindedness <b>even surpassed the Unitarianism of three or four
generations ago.&#8221;</b></p>

<p>2. <b>Christian Science.</b> This new science is not new, but is the
revival, through satanic powers, of ancient Gnosticism, a denial of
every article of the faith once and for all delivered unto the saints.
Prominent in this system is the denial of the physical resurrection, and
the bodily presence of the Lord Jesus in Glory. It is the masterpiece of
Satan. Its phenomenal growth attracts to its ranks such of the Christian
profession, who were never saved or whose knowledge of the truth of God
is insufficient. There will be no abatement of this great delusion. It
will continue to grow and become more powerful as the Gospel is denied
and God&#8217;s Word rejected.</p>

<p>3. <b>Millennial Dawnism.</b> This is another great and widespread
system. In it Satan appears even more so than in Christian Science as an
angel of light. It is offered throughout this land as &#8220;food for
Christians&#8221; and goes by the name of &#8220;Bible Study.&#8221; One
meets it everywhere. What is it? It is an amalgamation of several of the
evil theories concerning the Person of Christ, denying, like
Unitarianism and Christian Science, the absolute Deity of our Lord.
&#8220;Pastor&#8221; Russell in his books also denies the physical
resurrection of Christ. According to this system the body of our Lord
was either dissolved in its natural gases or is preserved as a memorial
somewhere. This, of course, means the denial of His bodily presence in
heaven. But think of it! To say that the body of our Lord was dissolved
in its natural gases, when the Word so clearly states &#8220;He could not
see corruption.&#8221;</p>

<center><h3><b>II.<br>

The Present Work of Christ; What It Is.</b></h3></center>

<p>As Man in Glory, crowned with glory and honor, He is occupied in a
present work.</p>

<p>He is in the presence of God as the Heir of all things. He is the
upholder of all and all things consist by Him. This great universe, with
its innumerable stars and suns, is under His control; it belongs to Him.
How man ever since the fall attempts to penetrate the mysterious depths
of the universe! Scientists with their glasses scan the heavens and try
to regain the knowledge of creation, which was lost by the fall of man,
Their discoveries astonish us. How marvelous the heavens are! How they
declare the glory of God and the firmament His handiwork! Often too has
the search of fallen man into the depths of the universe demonstrated
the truth of God given by revelation in His word. And yet the great
questions we ask of astronomers concerning this great universe are
answered with &#8220;we do not know.&#8221; Some day in the twinkling of an
eye we shall know more about this great universe than all the knowledge
gained by fallen man. But this universe rests in the hands of the Man in
Glory. He is the great central sun around which all revolves. We do not
know if there is any work to be done in connection with the great bodies
which we see in the great space about us. We do not know what changes go
on there. But we do know that all is in His hands. All is under His
control.</p>

<p>We must also think of the angels, the heavenly hosts. He has been
made, after His passion, so much better than the angels, as He hath by
inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they (Heb. i:4). What
may go on in this great world above, the world of unseen spirits, who
can tell? But they are all under His control. How He sends them forth
and uses them in His providential dealings with His people on earth, and
how He restrains through these unseen agencies the wrath of the enemy
and the evil work of demons, we do not know fully. &#8220;Are they not all
ministering spirits sent forth to minister to them, who shall be heirs
of salvation&#8221; (Heb. i:14). This and much else, though not fully
revealed, and hidden from us, belongs also to His present work. We
mention this that we might have a higher estimate of our Lord and
realize anew what a mighty and wonderful Lord we have.</p>

<p>But there is a present work of our Lord in Glory, which is fully
revealed in His Word.</p>

<p>In the first place, He is the <b>Mediator</b> between God and Man,
and being preached as such to the world, He exercises His office as the
Mediator throughout this present age (1 Tim. ii:5-6). Besides this
Mediatorship, He has a service which concerns those for whom He died and
who, by personal faith, have accepted Him as their Saviour.</p>

<center><h3><b>The Lord Knoweth His Own.</b></h3></center>

<p>&#8220;The Lord knoweth them that are His.&#8221; What a blessed thought
of comfort and cheer it is, which should forever banish fear and
unbelief! The Lord, the One seated there in the Holiest, knows us
personally. He knew us before we ever were in existence. He saw us
before the foundation of the world. He knew all our vileness and the
depths of degradation. He knew us as we wandered in our sins. His loving
eyes followed us then. He sought us in His love and brought us to
Himself. He gave us His life and dwells in us. Each believing sinner,
saved by grace, is one Spirit with the Lord. &#8220;I know my sheep.&#8221;
He calleth each by name, like a Shepherd calleth his own sheep. Again He
said &#8220;I know them.&#8221; What a comfort it should be to our hearts,
that He knows each of us by name. He knows our circumstances, trials,
difficulties and temptations. He knows our conflicts and our tears.
&#8220;He knoweth the way which I take.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is very precious! In the xxxii Psalm we find the comforting word
for one whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered, &#8220;I
will guide thee with mine eye,&#8221; or as it should read, &#8220;I will
guide thee with mine eye upon thee.&#8221; That eye up yonder, that eye
which measures the depths of the universe, which follows every planet,
that eye which neither sleeps nor slumbers, that all-seeing eye rests
upon us. He is occupied with each. The millions of His people who have
lived and died, who passed through life and are now at home with Him,
were each individually the objects of His care. His loving eye was upon
the multitudes of martyrs. He knew and watched that poor tortured saint,
who was cast with broken bones into a dungeon to starve to death. His
power and love rested upon those who were burned or cast before the wild
animals. For each He served and worked. And so He does still. Oh, the
preciousness that each believer is under the loving care of the Man in
Glory, the object of His love. Let us turn to a few Scriptures which
reveal this fact.</p>

<center><h3><b>Living for Us.</b></h3></center>

<p>In Romans v:10 we read:</p>

<p>&#8220;For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the
death of His Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by His
life.&#8221;</p>

<p>What life is meant by which we are saved? Some have applied it to the
life of the Lord Jesus Christ before His death on the cross, as if that
righteous life, that perfect life, had any saving power in it for us.
Hence the teaching that the righteousness of His life is imputed unto
us. This is wrong. The life, of which this verse speaks, is the life
which He lives now in the Presence of God. When we were enemies we were
reconciled to God by the death of His Son. And now being reconciled,
much more are we saved by His life. By His life there, because He is
there, we are saved and kept down here.</p>

<p>Another passage in Romans may be linked with this. Romans
viii:34:</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather,
that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also
maketh intercession for us.&#8221;</p>

<p>The risen Christ is at the right hand of God and maketh intercession
for us. However, not in the Epistle to the Romans is this present work
of Christ as the intercessor of His redeemed people revealed, but in the
Epistle to the Hebrews. There we read in the ninth chapter, &#8220;For
Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are
the figures of the true: but into heaven itself, <b>now to appear in the
presence of God for us.&#8221;</b> (Heb. ix:24).</p>

<p>And again in chapter vii:24, 25: &#8220;But this <b>man</b>, because he
continueth forever, hath an unchangeable priesthood. Wherefore he is
able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him,
seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.&#8221;</p>

<p>But notice all this is not spoken of those who are unsaved and live
in sin. The unsaved who are not yet Christ&#8217;s have no share in all
this. For the unsaved world the Lord is not the intercessor. He declared
this truth first of all in His high-priestly prayer, when He said,
&#8220;I pray for them, I pray not for the world&#8221; (John xvii:9).</p>

<p>This was also foreshadowed in the Old Testament. The High Priest in
His garments of Beauty and Glory had upon his shoulders two onyx stones,
and upon his breast a breastplate with twelve stones. Upon both the onyx
stones, upon the shoulder and the twelve stones on the breastplate there
were names engraven. But these were not the names of the Egyptians, the
Jebusites, the Amorites or the Hittites, but the names of the twelve
tribes of Israel. Our high priest in the highest heaven carries His own
upon His shoulders, which typify His power, and upon His bosom He
carrieth them; the bosom tells of His love. We are the objects of the
power and the love of Him who appears in the presence of God for us. The
fact that the names of the Israelites were engraven upon these precious
stones also has a meaning. If they had been written there, they might be
blotted out. They were engraven and could never be erased. It tells out
the blessed truth of our security.</p>

<center><h3><b>His Priesthood.</b></h3></center>

<p>Two other passages in Hebrews reveal some of the blessed details of
the present priestly work of the Lord in our behalf. &#8220;Wherefore in
all things it behooved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he
might be a merciful and faithful High Priest in things pertaining to
God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people. For in that he
himself hath suffered, being tempted, he is able to succour them that
are tempted&#8221; (Hebrews ii:17, 18). &#8220;Seeing then that we have a
great High Priest, that is passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of
God, let us hold fast our confession. For we have not an high priest
which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in
all points tempted like we are, apart from sin. Let us therefore come
boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find
grace to help in time of need&#8221; (Hebrews iv:14-16).</p>

<p>The first passage tells of the propitiation He made for the sins of
the people. He suffered, being tempted, and this is the basis of His
intercessory service. The passage from the fourth chapter tells us how
He was fitted while on earth for this great office work. While down here
He was tempted in all points as we are, apart from sin. From sin within
He could never be tempted, for no sin was in Him. He has gone through
the trials, the difficulties and sufferings a man who depends on God is
subject to while in this world, with the exception of sin. He has known
while on earth every possible difficulty. Now He can be a merciful and
faithful high priest and as such enter into all our sorrows and trials.
He sympathizes with us in all our conflicts and difficulties down here.
However, He does not intercede for the flesh&#8212;He has no sympathy
with sin. By His gracious and unbroken intercession in the sanctuary, He
upholds us individually in the path down here. He gives strength to
endure. If it were not for that intercession, we all would fall by the
way. How often God&#8217;s people fear troubles and difficulties, losses
and bereavements, which might possibly come. What, if this favored child
should be taken from me, how could I stand it? Or, if I should lose her
whom I love? Or my health should fail? Perhaps my business and income
stops, how could I ever stand it? Often that which we fear comes upon
us. That loved one is taken and is put into a grave. Health fails and
the income stops; instead of plenty there is want. But with the trial,
with the loss, there comes such a strength to bear it all, and more than
that, real joy and songs of praise. It is because the great High Priest
lives and intercedes. He knows all about it and in the tenderness of His
love and the might of His power, He takes us in His loving arms whenever
trials and troubles come upon us. At all times under all circumstances
He is our representative before God and thinks of us.</p>

<p>And so it is with our temptations and our warfare with the wicked
spirits. The enemy we have is most powerful and intelligent. He knows
how to spread his nets. His wiles are most subtle. If Satan had his way
he would overthrow and destroy completely the people of God on earth. If
it depended on our strength, we would soon fall. But He knows. His eyes
watch the enemy as they watch us. Peter&#8217;s case illustrates this
perfectly. He saw the old serpent as he moved on his way towards Peter.
He knew the cunning plan Satan had conceived to ensnare Peter. In Judas
he had entered and taken complete possession of the disciple, who was
never born again. He planned to fell Peter completely and rush him
afterwards into despair. But Satan did not reckon with Peter&#8217;s
Lord. Before the plan could ever be carried out, the Lord had prayed for
Peter that His faith may not fail. And though Peter denied the Lord and
fell, the Lord&#8217;s gracious intercession kept him through it all. And
this is still the case with us. He prays for us before that foe can ever
approach us and thus we can be victorious in the conflict and should we
stumble and fall, as it is so often the case, then He is the great
shepherd &#8220;who restoreth my soul.&#8221; How much we owe to this
blessed, precious present work of our Lord in Glory no one knows. What
blessed revelation there will come to us when we shall know as we are
known, when we look back over our lives and behold what the intercession
of the Lord Jesus accomplished for us and all the Saints of God! We have
a great high priest who is passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of
God.</p>

<p>Another phase of His priestly present work is recorded in Heb.
xiii:15. &#8220;By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to
God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his
name.&#8221; He presents our spiritual sacrifices to God. Our worship,
our praise and our prayers we address to God, the God and Father of our
Lord Jesus Christ, are all imperfect, but as they are presented to God
by Him, they are acceptable unto God and delight the heart of God for
that reason.</p>

<center><h3><b>His Advocacy.</b></h3></center>

<p>But there is a second aspect of His work in Glory in the presence of
God for His people. He is our advocate with the Father. Some Christians
think that the Priesthood and Advocacy of Christ are one and the same.
They are not. His advocacy is that which restores us. In the first
Epistle of John we read of this phase of His present work. &#8220;My
little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if
any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the
righteous&#8221; (John ii:1).</p>

<p>In the preceding chapter our wonderful privilege as the children of
God is made known. We are to be in fellowship with the Father and with
His Son Jesus Christ. What does that mean? Fellowship with the Father is
when we delight ourselves in His basket Son, who is His delight, when we
share the Father&#8217;s own thoughts about Him. The Son knoweth the
Father and He has revealed Him and brought us into His own relationship
with the Father. Fellowship with His Son is to enjoy this relationship
with the Father. The condition for the enjoyment of this privilege in
reality, fellowship with the Father and with His Son is, that we walk in
the light as He is in the light. These blessed things were written that
we sin not. Sin cannot rob us of our salvation, but it mars the
enjoyment of that fellowship. The standard is that we sin not, and if we
live in constant enjoyment of that blessed fellowship into which grace
has brought us, we do not sin. But how often this is not the case. We
fall into sin. Then the blessed revelation is given: &#8220;If any man sin
we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous.&#8221;
How grateful we ought to be that it does not say: If any man repent. The
Lord&#8217;s intercession as advocate is independent of our repentance or
of our asking Him to do this for us. It is the exercise of grace in His
own loving heart toward us to restore our souls, to put us back into the
place where we can enjoy His fellowship. The moment the believer sins on
earth, He acts as the Advocate above. The Holy Spirit then likewise acts
in that He applies the Word to convict and cleanse. The cleansing is by
the water, the Word, and not a second time by the blood. Then follows
confession from our side and the restoration is effected. Also notice
that it does not say &#8220;we have an Advocate with God,&#8221; but
&#8220;with the Father.&#8221; It is a family matter, and the Father is a
Father who can do nothing but love those whom He has brought to himself
through His Son. The conception that the Father is angry with His
sinning child on earth, and that the Son of God by His pleadings
inclines the heart of God to be merciful, is an unscriptural one.
Another reason why He acts thus as Advocate is Satan, the accuser of the
brethren. He still has access into the presence of God. The day will
come when He is cast out of heaven, but that day will not come until the
church has been caught up to meet the Lord in the air.</p>

<p>&#8220;And the great dragon was cast out, that serpent, called the
Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into
the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come
salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of
His Christ; for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused
them before our God day and night&#8221; (Rev. xii:9-10).</p>

<p>Because Satan accuses God&#8217;s people before God day and night, the
Advocate is there to rebuke him. Every attack by accusation of the
sinning children of God, the Lord Jesus Christ meets with the fact that
He made propitiation; He died for their sins.</p>

<center><h3><b>He Shall not Fail nor be Discouraged.</b></h3></center>

<p>And this work of Himself as our Priest, the merciful and faithful
High Priest and our Advocate goes on up yonder uninterruptedly. In
Isaiah we find a word which speaks of Him, <b>&#8220;He shall not fail nor
be discouraged.&#8221;</b> Well may we apply this to His present work as
Priest and Advocate of His own. As Priest He will never fail. He will
never fail in being about His own, in keeping them and sustaining them,
in sending them help from the sanctuary in time of need. As Advocate He
will not be discouraged. The same old failures in our lives, which
humble us and break us down, but He continues in this service in behalf
of His poor sinning people. Some Christians do not believe in the
fundamental doctrine of the Gospel, that a child of God in possession of
eternal life can never be lost. They think it depends on their walk and
service. If one of His own could ever be lost again, if even the
weakest, the most imperfect could be snatched out of His hands, His
present work would be a failure as well as His finished work on the
cross. But read the great high-priestly prayer He left for us in John
xvii. There He prays the Father, who heareth Him always, that His own
may be kept.</p>

<center><h3><b>His Work for the Church.</b></h3></center>

<p>Another aspect of His present work is what He does for His church. We
can but briefly indicate what this means.</p>

<p>He is in glory the Head of the church. The church is His body, the
fullness of Him, that filleth all in all.</p>

<p>Every believing sinner is a member in that body. The risen Lord
Himself adds new members to that body. He puts each member into the body
as it pleases Him. Each member is guided and directed by Himself. He
supplies this body with gifts.</p>

<p>&#8220;And He gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some,
evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;</p>

<p>&#8220;For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry,
for the edifying of the body of Christ.</p>

<p>&#8220;Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge
of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature
of the fullness of Christ&#8221; (Eph. iv:11-13).</p>

<p>Thus He builds up from the Glory His own body. Some day that body
will be complete. Then we all come unto the measure of the stature of
the fullness of Christ. That will be when we see Him as He is. Then His
present work in behalf of His own, His coheirs, will be finished.
Brought home from this wilderness to the Father&#8217;s house&#8212;safe
home&#8212;there will be no need any longer for His power and love to
sustain us. No more tears will then be shed, no more wounds of pain and
sorrow to be soothed, no more help is needed for the time of need; all
that is passed. Nor does He then need to exercise His office as
Advocate, for we are delivered forever from the presence of sin and
sanctified wholly body, soul and spirit. Sinning is then an
impossibility. What a happy, glorious day that will be!</p>

<center><h3><b>III.<br> The Practical Results of His Present Work in the
Christian&#8217;s Life.</b></h3></center>

<p>The fact that the Lord Jesus Christ is in Glory occupied with us
should lead us into a holy life which glorifies Him. That loving eye is
never withdrawn from us. If we were to remember this constantly, what a
power this would be in our lives! How many things would remain undone,
how many words unspoken, and how many other things done, if we were
constantly conscious of that eye which is upon us individually. He
represents us before God, and we are to represent Him before men. A
Christian is called to manifest Christ to be His representative. And
such a life, which is unto His praise and Glory, is made possible
through His blessed intercessory work and His presence in heaven. A true
Christian life depends much on this heart occupation with the Person and
work of Christ. As His presence up yonder and His service for us is a
reality to our hearts through the power of the Holy Spirit, we shall
walk worthy of the Lord, and His blessed work for us will constantly be
felt in our lives here on earth. What a joy it is then, as we reckon
only with Him, who knows us, to serve Him, to depend on Him. And how we
should shun anything which grieves Him.</p>

<center><h3><b>Encouragement for Prayer.</b></h3></center>

<p>These blessed facts of the Lord&#8217;s loving interest in us and our
life in this present evil age, surrounded by dangers and evils of all
kinds, will be a great encouragement to us in our prayer life. We can go
and tell Him all about that which troubles us. If He is interested in
everything which happens to us, down to the smallest matter, then we can
go to him in prayer and tell Him about it. Some Christians teach that we
should not do this, but leave it all in His hands without praying for
it, satisfied that His will be done. But this is contrary to Scripture,
for it says that in <b>everything</b> by prayer and supplication with
thanksgiving we are to make our requests known (Phil. iv:6). He delights
to have us tell Him, and like John&#8217;s disciples we can go to Him and
tell Him. His ear is always open. If in His service we become tired and
weary, we can tell Him, for He was tired on account of the way. If
hungry or without a resting place, He knows what that means, for He
passed through this. If lonely and our best services are misunderstood,
or the fiery darts of the enemy are aimed against us, we can speak to
Him about it. All this can be so very real to us if we but go on led by
His spirit.</p>

<center><h3><b>Deliverance from Worry.</b></h3></center>

<p>It should make an end of all worry and anxiety. We may possess a
divine carelessness. Be careful for nothing. Have no anxiety. Why should
we worry or be anxious? Worry is the child of unbelief. Anxiety can
never stay if the eyes of the heart behold the man in Glory and faith
realizes that all is in the hands of One &#8220;who doeth all things
well.&#8221; Worry and anxiety accuse Him. Martha did that when she was
encumbered with much service and then said to Him, &#8220;Dost Thou not
care?&#8221; Each time we give way to anxiety, we act as if He did not
care. But He does; and He would have us rest in faith and commit all to
Himself.</p>

<center><h3><b>Sharing His Work.</b></h3></center>

<p>In conclusion we must not forget that He permits us to have some
share in this blessed work of His. While He prays for us, we can pray
one for another, and for all the saints. He intercedes; we can
intercede. He washes our feet, typical of the cleansing by the Word. We
are to wash one another&#8217;s feet. He carries our burdens, but the
exhortation also is that we carry one another&#8217;s burden. He forgives
and restores. We are to forbear one another, and forgive one another,
&#8220;even as Christ forgave us&#8221; (Col. iii:13).</p>

<a name="future"></a>
<center><h3><b>III.<br>
HIS FUTURE WORK.</b></h3></center>

<p>The Lord Jesus Christ, who finished the work on earth the Father gave
Him to do, who is now bodily present in the highest heaven, occupying
the Father&#8217;s throne and exercising His priesthood in behalf of His
people, is also King. To Him belongeth a Kingdom and a kingly Glory. He
has therefore a kingly work to do. While His past work was foretold by
the Spirit of God and His priestly work foreshadowed in the Old
Testament, His work as King and His glorious Kingdom to come are
likewise the subjects of the Word of God.</p>

<center><h3><b>Predicted by the Prophets.</b></h3></center>

<p>His kingly work was announced by Gabriel to the Virgin. &#8220;The Lord
God shall give unto Him the throne of His father David and He shall
reign over the house of David forever; and of His Kingdom there shall be
no end&#8221; (Luke i:32, 33). According to this message He must occupy
the throne of His father David, He must reign and possess a Kingdom.
This is but heaven&#8217;s confirmation of what God&#8217;s prophets for
many centuries had uttered in announcing the coming of the Messiah. The
entire prophetic Word has its climax in the visions of the King and the
Kingdom, He will receive on this earth. These visions of glory to come,
for Him who was despised and rejected of men, are the glittering stars
shining throughout the dark night of the past and present age. They
dazzle the eyes of faith. They inspire hope and courage. We quote a few
Scriptures which relate to the Christ as King.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet I have set my King upon my holy hill of Zion. I will declare
the decree: the Lord has said unto Me, Thou art my Son, this day have I
begotten Thee. Ask of Me, and I shall give Thee the nations for Thine
inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for Thy
possession&#8221; (Ps. ii:6-8). &#8220;It is He that will judge the world
in righteousness&#8221; (Ps. xi:7). &#8220;All the ends of the world shall
remember and turn unto the Lord, and all the kindreds of the nations
shall worship before Thee. For the Kingdom is the Lord&#8217;s and He is
the governor among the nations&#8221; (Ps. xxii:27-28). &#8220;Lift up your
heads, O ye gates; even lift them up, ye everlasting doors; and the King
of Glory shall come in. Who is this King of Glory? The Lord of hosts, He
is the King of Glory&#8221; (Ps. xxiv:9-10). &#8220;All ye peoples clap
your hands, shout unto God with the voice of triumph! For Jehovah, the
Most High, is terrible, a great King over all the earth&#8221; (Ps.
xlvii:2). &#8220;He shall judge thy people with righteousness, and the
poor with judgment.&#8221; &#8220;Yea, all Kings shall fall down before
Him; all nations shall serve Him.&#8221; &#8220;His name shall endure
forever&#8212;all nations shall call Him blessed&#8221; (Ps. lxxii:1, 11,
17). &#8220;Also, I will make Him my Firstborn, higher than the Kings of
the earth&#8221; (Ps. lxxxix:27). &#8220;Behold, a King shall reign in
righteousness&#8221; (Is. xxxii:1). &#8220;Behold the days come, that I
will raise unto David a righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and
prosper, and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth&#8221; (Jer.
xxiii:5). &#8220;I saw in the night visions, and behold there came with
the clouds of heaven one like a Son of Man&#8212;and there was given Him
dominion and glory, and a Kingdom, that all peoples, nations and
languages should serve Him; His dominion is an everlasting dominion
which shall not pass away, and His Kingdom which shall not be
destroyed&#8221; (Dan. vii:13-14). &#8220;Behold the man, whose name is the
Branch, and he shall grow up out of his place, and he shall build the
temple of the Lord. Even he shall build the temple of the Lord; and he
shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule upon his throne; and he
shall be a priest upon his throne, and the counsel of peace shall be
between them both&#8221; (Zech. vi:12, 13). &#8220;And Jehovah shall be
King over all the earth&#8221; (Zech. xiii:9).</p>

<p>All these prophecies and many more speak of the Lord Jesus as King
and bear witness of His Kingdom. The glories of His Kingdom are likewise
described by the holy men of God, the mouthpieces of the Spirit of
God.</p>

<center><h3><b>Not Yet Fulfilled.</b></h3></center>

<p>Were these predictions fulfilled since the Lord Jesus Christ suffered
on the Cross? Have they been fulfilled since He entered the
Father&#8217;s presence in Glory? Is He now exercising His kingly rule
and authority? Is the promised Kingdom of righteousness, of peace, of
power and glory now on this earth?</p>

<p>These questions arise at once in reading these divine predictions.
They must be answered in the negative. The Lord Jesus Christ has not
even begun His work as King. The Kingdom promised unto Him, He has not
yet received. There is now no such Kingdom of glory and power on
earth.</p>

<center><h3><b>The New Testament Evidence.</b></h3></center>

<p>The New Testament furnishes the completest evidence that our Lord is
not King over all the earth, and that His kingly rule is still in the
future. The notion that the church is the Kingdom in which the Lord
Jesus Christ rules as King, and that the Old Testament predictions of
Kingdom glories are realized spiritually in the church, is a pure
invention. Nowhere is the church called the Kingdom, nor do we find the
Lord Jesus ever called &#8220;the King of the Church.&#8221; He is the Head
of the church, which is His body. The New Testament still looks forward
to the Kingdom to come. The Lord has left the earth to receive a Kingdom
and to return (Luke xix:11-28). He occupies the Father&#8217;s throne,
which is not His permanent place, for He is to have His own throne.
&#8220;When the Son of Man shall come in His glory, and all the holy
angels with Him, then shall He sit upon the throne of His glory&#8221;
(Matt. xxv:31). He waits in heaven for the time when all enemies will be
made the footstool of His feet (Heb. x:13). &#8220;But now we see not yet
all things put under Him&#8221; (Heb. ii:8). No nation serves Him and the
Kingdoms of this world are not His Kingdoms during this age. They will
become His and heaven will resound with many voices saying: &#8220;The
kingdoms of this world are become the kingdom of our Lord and of His
Christ and He shall reign forever and ever&#8221; (Rev. xi:15). But that
is future. When the seventh angel sounds His trumpet, when heaven opens
and He appears as King of kings, crowned with many crowns (Rev.
xix:11-16), then He will receive the nations for His inheritance.</p>

<center><h3><b>I.<br> How Christ Begins His Future
Work.</b></h3></center>

<p>The beginning of Christ&#8217;s future work is revealed in 1
Thessalonians iv:15-18. This Scripture contains a great and unique
revelation, unknown in the Old Testament. The Lord had made the promise
to His disciples, &#8220;I will come again and receive you unto Myself,
that where I am ye may be also&#8221; (John xiv:3). He did not tell them
in what manner He would keep this most precious promise. In the first
Epistle to the Thessalonians the Lord gives the details of His coming
for His own, and how He will fulfill the promise given to His disciples.
He promises that He will descend from heaven with a shout. When He
accomplished His work on the cross, He gave a shout, for he cried with a
loud voice &#8220;Tetelestei&#8221;&#8212;&#8220;It is finished!&#8221; As the
risen One, He met His beloved ones and said &#8220;All Hail!&#8221; The
Greek gives only one word, &#8220;Chairete&#8221;&#8212;&#8220;Oh! the
Joy!&#8221; This is His resurrection shout, the shout of joy and victory.
And when He ascended He went up with a shout (Ps. xlvii:5). First
Thessalonians iv:16 tells us He is going to descend with a shout. He
passed through the heavens in His glorious ascension and entered into
the presence of God, His Father. Some day He will arise from the place
He occupies on the Throne of God. He will leave the place on the right
hand of the Majesty on high and pass out of the third heaven. Once more
He passeth through the heavens, not upward but downward. He comes to
call His Saints to meet Him. The meeting-place is not the Mount of
Olives, Jerusalem or any earthly place; the meeting-place will be in the
air. We repeat, this is a revelation, which is not found in the Old
Testament prophetic Word, nor did the Lord announce it fully in His
earthly ministry. According to the passage containing this revelation,
the shout of the Lord as He descends into the air will be followed by
the resurrection of the dead in Christ. All the Saints of God will be
raised physically from the graves. This includes the Old Testament and
New Testament believers. When this shout is heard and the righteous dead
are raised, all belonging to Christ and living in that day, will be
caught up together with them in clouds to meet the Lord in the air. For
the sake of some, we add, that all who have accepted the Lord Jesus
Christ as Saviour, who received eternal life and the Spirit of God,
belong to Him and their blessed Hope and destiny is to be &#8220;caught up
in clouds to meet the Lord in the air.&#8221; Some teach that in order to
share this rapture certain attainments are needed. Such, however, is not
the case. No service, suffering, separation or any works we do, could
ever fit us for such a marvelous event. Grace has accomplished it for
us. In 1 Cor. xv:51 we read: &#8220;Behold I show you a mystery, we shall
not all sleep, but we shall all be changed in a moment, etc.&#8221; The
&#8220;all&#8221; means all that are Christ&#8217;s at His coming,
independent of their knowledge about dispensational truths, independent
of their waiting for Him, or any other thing. That they belong to Him
and are redeemed by His precious blood is a sufficient title to be
caught up and to meet Him in the air.</p>

<p>Of this double company, saints who died and who will be raised from
the dead, and saints who live and will be changed in a moment and caught
up to meet Him, we find a hint in His words in John xi:25-26. &#8220;I am
the resurrection and the life; he that believeth in Me, though he were
dead, yet shall he live (Resurrection). And whosoever liveth (when He
comes) and believeth in Me shall never die (The changing of living
believers). Believest thou this?&#8221; May we answer Him, Yea, Lord, I
believe. We may not understand all the details of this wonderful event,
an event which will come suddenly, but we can believe His promise and
wait daily for its glorious fulfillment. This is the blessed Hope of the
Church. For this we are told to wait. Ere He begins His judgment work,
before the last scenes of tribulation and wrath can be enacted upon this
earth and He returns as the King of Glory to claim His blood-bought
inheritance, He will come into the air to meet His redeemed host and
co-heirs. This is the first event in connection with His future
work.</p>

<center><h3><b>The Judgment Seat of Christ.</b></h3></center>

<p>All judgment is to be executed by the Lord Jesus Christ. &#8220;For the
Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the
Son&#8221; (John v:22). Up to the present time no judgment work has been
done by Him. Nor have His people received their crowns and rewards for
service and faithfulness. The meeting of the Saints in the presence of
the Lord will be immediately followed by the judgment seat of Christ.
&#8220;For we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ&#8221;
(Rom. xiv:10). &#8220;For we must all appear before the judgment seat of
Christ; that everyone may receive the things done in his body, according
to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad&#8221; (2 Cor. v:10). No
unsaved person appears before this judgment for they were not raised
from the dead, nor changed in the twinkling of an eye. This judgment
concerns only believers. This judgment, however, does not decide their
eternal salvation. That was settled when they believed on the Lord Jesus
Christ. The words of our Lord in John v:24 make this clear. &#8220;Verily,
verily, I say unto you, He that heareth My word, and believeth on Him
that sent Me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into
condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.&#8221; &#8220;There is
therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ&#8221; (Rom.
viii:1). The works and the service of His people will be dealt with by
the Lord in this first judgment act in His future work. Of this we read
in 1 Cor. iv:5&#8212;&#8220;Therefore judge nothing before the time, until
the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of
darkness, and will make manifest the hidden counsels of the hearts; and
then shall have every man praise of God.&#8221;</p>

<p>Everything will be made manifest before that judgment seat. The
unconfessed sins in the believer&#8217;s life will be brought to light
and all hidden things will be uncovered. Then the works of the believer
will be made manifest. &#8220;Every man&#8217;s work shall be made
manifest; for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by
fire; and the fire shall try every man&#8217;s work of what sort it is.
If any man&#8217;s work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall
receive a reward. If any man&#8217;s work shall be burned, he shall
suffer loss; but he himself shall be saved, yet so as by fire&#8221; (1
Cor. iii:13-15). It will be the time when God&#8217;s people will receive
their rewards and crowns. Then the Apostles, the faithful martyrs, the
self-sacrificing missionaries and servants of God will receive praise
and reward for their labors. The judgment seat is the reward seat of
Christ. In view of this the Apostle wrote to the faithful Thessalonians:
&#8220;For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not even
ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at His coming? For ye are
our glory and joy&#8221; (1 Thess. ii:19-20). And the Apostle John
exhorts: &#8220;And now little children, abide in Him; that when He shall
appear, we (the apostles and teachers) may have confidence, and not be
ashamed before Him at His Coming&#8221; (1 John ii:28). All believers in
Christ are saved and have eternal life; but not all receive a reward.
Their works will be consumed by the fire of that judgment, for they were
nothing but wood, hay and stubble. They will go rewardless, while the
faithful saints, who toiled and served, who spent and were spent,
following closely in His steps, will receive rewards. What these will be
no Saint does know at this time.</p>

<p>When all is accomplished in connection with this judgment seat of
Christ, He will lead His Saints into the Father&#8217;s house, that they
may behold His glory (John xvii:24). He will present the church to
Himself, &#8220;a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any
such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish&#8221; (Eph.
v:27). He presents His church &#8220;faultless before the presence of His
glory with exceeding joy&#8221; (Jude 24).</p>

<center><h3><b>II.<br> His Future Work in Connection with the
Earth.</b></h3></center>

<p>When the Saints of God have left the earth and met the Lord in the
air, when the events took place we have briefly outlined, then the Lord
Jesus Christ will begin from heaven a work which will be severely felt
on the earth. He begins to deal with the world in a series of judgments.
From the Book of Revelation we learn that the &#8220;Lion of the tribe of
Judah the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and loose the
seven seals thereof.&#8221; (Rev. v:5). The book He receives contains the
judgments decreed for this earth with its apostate masses. The Lamb is
seen opening the seals of the book, and as He breaks the seals the
events described under each seal happen. It is His work in judgment. In
the eighth chapter of Revelation an Angel is seen before an altar with a
golden censer. &#8220;And the angel took the censer, and filled it with
fire of the altar, and cast it into the earth, and there were voices,
and thunderings, and lightnings and an earthquake. And the seven angels
which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound&#8221; (Rev.
viii:5, 6). This Angel is the Lord Jesus Christ. He casts down the fire
of divine displeasure and judgment upon the earth. The seven trumpeting
angels with their judgments for the earth are sent forth by Him. Then
come seven other angels, who pour out the bowls filled with the wrath of
God. We cannot examine all those judgments separately. There is no human
being who can realize what they all mean and what it will be when the
Lord deals with this earth in righteousness.</p>

<center><h3><b>Israel and the Nations.</b></h3></center>

<p>Israel and the nations will pass through those judgments executed
from above. Christendom apostate, God defying and Christ rejecting
Christendom, will like Pharaoh, be hardened by them. They do not repent,
but rather believe the strong delusion and accept the man of sin with
his lying wonders. The Jewish people will in part be restored to their
land. The great tribulation centers in their land and will be felt there
in its severest form. The apostate portion of the Jews will worship the
false Christ and will therefore be visited by these righteous judgments.
But there is also a remnant of God-fearing Jews, who believe the Word of
God, who expect the Kingdom and the King. While these believing Jews
suffer, they also serve. They are the last messengers of the King. They
herald once more the Gospel of the Kingdom and will bear witness of it
to all the nations of the earth, before the end comes (Matt.
xxiv:14).*</p>

<p><small>* We refer the reader to our larger works, which deal more fully with
these coming events. Daniel, Joel, Commentary on Matthew, Harmony of the
Prophetic Word, Things to Come, etc., deal more fully with these truths.

<center><h3><b>Nations Learning Righteousness.</b></h3></center>

<p>&#8220;When Thy judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the
world will learn righteousness&#8221; (Isaiah xxvi:9). A work of
salvation will go on during those seven years of judgment, tribulation
and wrath. A great multitude, which no man can number, of all nations,
and kindreds, and people, and tongues, come out of the great tribulation
and have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb
(Rev. vii:9-17). They heard and believed the final testimony as preached
by the Jewish remnant. Heathen nations will accept the Gospel of the
Kingdom, while apostate Christendom is excluded, for they received not
the love of the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness (2 Thess.
ii).</p>

<center><h3><b>His Glorious Appearing.</b></h3></center>

<p>&#8220;Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be
darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall
fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken. And
then shall appear the sign of the Son of Man in heaven; and then shall
all the tribes of the earth mourn and they shall see the Son of Man
coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory&#8221; (Matthew
xxiv:29-30). &#8220;Behold, He cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see
Him, and they also which pierced Him, and all kindreds of the earth
shall wail because of Him. Even so, Amen&#8221; (Rev. i:7). &#8220;And I
saw heaven opened and behold a white horse, and he that sat upon him was
called Faithful and True, and in righteousness He doth judge and make
war. His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on His head were many crowns;
and He had a name written, that no man knew, but He Himself. And He was
clothed in a vesture dipped with blood; and His name is called the Word
of God. And the armies which were in heaven followed Him upon white
horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean. And out of His mouth
goeth a sharp sword, that with it He should smite the nations; and He
shall rule them with a rod of iron and He treadeth the winepress of the
fierceness and wrath of Almighty God. And He hath on His vesture and on
His thigh a name written, King of Kings and Lord of Lords&#8221; (Rev.
xix:11-16).</p>

<center><h3><b>The King in His Glory.</b></h3></center>

<p>Every eye shall see Him, when He appears in glorious majesty as the
King of Kings. His glory will cover the heavens (Hab. iii:3). Every
tongue which denied Him will be forever hushed. His second, personal,
visible and glorious coming will be the crowning and unanswerable proof
of His Deity. His incarnation and all the work He accomplished on earth
and in glory, can then no longer be denied. His glorious appearing will
silence all His enemies. His rejection ends and His glory as God&#8217;s
appointed King and ruler over this earth, He purchased with His blood,
begins. Every knee must then bow before Him and every tongue confess
that He is Lord.</p>

<p>And when He appears in all His glory, He does not come alone. His
Saints come with Him. When He appears, then shall we also appear with
Him in glory (Col. iii:4). In that day of triumph and glory, He will be
glorified in His Saints and admired in all them that believed (2 Thess.
i:10). Wonderful spectacle it will be, when He brings His many sons with
Him unto glory! All will be conformed into the same image.</p>

<center><h3><b>His Judgment-Work.</b></h3></center>

<p>His feet will stand once more upon the Mount of Olives (Zech. xiv:4).
Before Him is Jerusalem and all nations are gathered against it to
battle (Zech. xiv:2). The Beast will be their leader, while the Man of
Sin, the Anti-christ, will do his dreadful work in the city itself. The
remnant of Israel in great distress will then pray and look for
deliverance. The coming of the King will bring that deliverance. They
will shout then for joy and say in that day, &#8220;Lo, this is our God,
we have waited for Him, and He will save us; this is the Lord; we have
waited for Him; we will be glad and rejoice in His salvation&#8221;
(Isaiah xxv:9). They will welcome the once rejected One. &#8220;Blessed is
He that cometh in the name of the Lord&#8221; (Matt. xxiii:39). And He
will fight against those nations. The great battle of Armageddon will
then take place. &#8220;The beasts and the Kings of the earth, and their
armies, gathered together to make war against Him that sat on the horse,
and against his army&#8221; (Rev. xix:19). But their opposition will
suddenly be broken to pieces. &#8220;And the beast was taken, and with him
the false prophet (the Anti-christ) that wrought miracles before him,
with which he deceived them that received the mark of the beast, and
them that worshipped the image. These both were cast alive into a lake
of fire burning with brimstone&#8221; (Rev. xix:20).</p>

<center><h3><b>On His Throne.</b></h3></center>

<p>&#8220;When the Son of Man shall come in His glory, and all the holy
angels with Him, then shall He sit upon the throne of His glory&#8221;
(Matt. xxv:31). The judgment which will then be executed by Him is not a
universal judgment (the dead are not mentioned), but it will be a
judgment of the living nations in the day when He appears the second
time. Some nations are put on His right side and He calls them &#8220;the
blessed of my Father;&#8221; they inherit the Kingdom which will then be
established on the earth. That these righteous nations are not church
saints is obvious, for the church, as we have seen, was caught up in the
beginning of His future work to meet Him in the air and is associated
with Him when He comes in power and glory. Then there are other nations
which are put on His left hand and they shall go away from that judgment
throne into everlasting punishment (Matt. xxv:46). But what is the
standard of this judgment? What they did to the Lord&#8217;s brethren or
what they did not unto them. The Lord&#8217;s brethren, according to the
flesh are the Jews. During the tribulation period believing Jews will
preach the Gospel of the Kingdom to all nations (Matt. xxiv:14). The
nations who believed this last offer of mercy treated the messengers in
kindness; those who did not believe the message did not treat them in
that way. And when this great judgment is passed, His Kingdom of
righteousness and peace will be established on this earth. Righteousness
will begin to reign as grace reigns now through righteousness.</p>

<center><h3><b>III.<br> The Glories of His Kingdom.</b></h3></center>

<p>&#8220;And in the days of those Kings shall the God of heaven set up a
Kingdom, which shall never be destroyed, and the Kingdom shall not be
left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these
Kingdoms, and it shall stand forever&#8221; (Dan. ii:44). &#8220;I saw in
the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of Man came with the
clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancients of days, and they brought Him
near before Him. And there was given Him dominion, and glory, and a
kingdom, that all people, nations and languages should serve Him; His
dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and His
Kingdom that which shall not be destroyed&#8221; (Dan. vii:13-14). A
closer study of these two fundamental passages from Daniel&#8217;s great
prophecies will establish the fact that this promised Kingdom comes with
the second coming of Christ. It will be preceded by a judgment blow at
the earth Kingdoms; Nebuchadnezzar beheld this in his prophetic
dream.</p>

<p>This Kingdom is an earthly Kingdom and all the nations will be
gathered into that Kingdom. Jerusalem and a converted Israel will be the
center of it. The Lord Jesus Christ and His Saints will reign with Him
over the earth and over this Kingdom. And what will be His work then?
But a few of the many things can be mentioned. &#8220;He shall speak peace
to the nations&#8221; (Zech. ix:10). &#8220;With righteousness shall He
judge the poor, and reprove with equity the meek of the earth.&#8221;
(Isaiah xi:4). &#8220;He shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles&#8221;
(Is. xlii:1). &#8220;And He shall judge among the nations, and shall
rebuke many people, and they shall beat their swords into plow-shares,
and their spears into pruninghooks; nation shall not lift up sword
against nation, neither shall they learn war any more&#8221; (Isaiah
ii:4). He shall also &#8220;set up an ensign for the nations, and shall
assemble the outcasts of Israel, and gather together the dispersed of
Judah from the four corners of the earth&#8221; (Isaiah xi:12). &#8220;And
many nations shall be joined to the Lord in that day, and shall be my
people&#8221; (Zech. ii:11). &#8220;And the Lord shall be King over all the
earth&#8221; (Zech. xiv:9). &#8220;Behold a King shall reign in
righteousness&#8221; (Isaiah xxxii:1). &#8220;A King shall reign and
prosper, and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth&#8221;
(Jere. xxiii:5).</p>

<p>Many more passages predicting and describing the Kingdom and its
glories might be added. All these blessed words mean exactly what they
say. Righteousness and peace will characterize that world-wide Kingdom
of the Lord Jesus Christ. His glory will cover the earth as the waters
cover the deep. Nations will worship Him. &#8220;Yea, all Kings shall fall
down before Him; all nations shall serve Him.&#8221; &#8220;He shall have
dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the
earth&#8221; (Ps. lxxii:8, 11). Every wrong will be righted on earth and
present-day evils and oppression, crime and vice, poverty and sickness
will be abolished. Only He has the power to do this. Oh! the glories of
the Kingdom! May we pray, &#8220;Even so, come, Lord Jesus.&#8221; Thy
Kingdom come.</p>

<center><h3><b>Creation Delivered.</b></h3></center>

<p>&#8220;For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the
manifestation of the Sons of God. For the creature was made subject to
vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the same
in hope, because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the
bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.
For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain
together until now&#8221; (Rom. viii:19-22). Sin has brought a curse upon
creation. The thorns and thistles are the result of the fall of man as
well as the blight and misery which rests upon a creation, which was
pronounced good by the Creator. But this condition into which creation
has been plunged will not continue forever. A better day is coming.
Groaning creation is to be delivered. The curse will be removed. This
cannot be the work of man. Scientists attempt to set things in order in
this ruined creation; but they fail. The things which destroy, the heat
and the drought, the storms and earthquakes, cannot be arrested by the
arm of man.</p>

<p>The Son of God wore the crown of thorns. The curse was put upon Him.
And He who created all things and paid for redemption by His precious
blood will, with omnipotent power, deliver groaning creation. It will
take place when the sons of God are manifested. The sons of God (the
redeemed) will be manifested with Him, as we have seen, in the day of
His visible appearing. Then the great vision of Isaiah will find its
fulfillment. &#8220;The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the
leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and
the fatling together; and a little child shall lead them. And the cow
and the bear shall feed; their young ones shall lie down together; and
the lion shall eat straw like the ox. And the suckling child shall play
on the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the
cockatrice den&#8221; (Isaiah xi:6-8).</p>

<center><h3><b>All Under His Feet.</b></h3></center>

<p>The dispensation of the fulness of times has come (Eph. i:10). All
things are put under Him. All His enemies are made His footstool. He is
Lord of all. The glorious reign of Christ, in kingly glory, in
fulfillment of the Prophet&#8217;s visions, will be followed by another
judgment.</p>

<center><h3><b>The Great White Throne.</b></h3></center>

<p>The second resurrection, that of the wicked dead, takes place at the
end of the Kingdom reign of Christ. This great judgment and the final
destiny of the wicked is revealed in Rev. xx:11-15. The Lord Jesus
Christ will be the judge in that awful scene, for it is written that
&#8220;all judgment is committed unto the Son&#8221; (John v:22).</p>

<center><h3><b>Then Cometh the End.</b></h3></center>

<p>&#8220;Then cometh the end, when He shall have delivered up the Kingdom
to God, even the Father; when He shall have put down all rule and all
authority and power. For He must reign, till He hath put all enemies
under His feet. The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death. . . .
And when all things shall be subdued unto Him, then shall the Son also
Himself be subject unto Him, who put all things under Him, that God may
be all in all&#8221; (1 Cor. xv:24-28).</p>

<p>Then He will create a new heaven and a new earth, the eternal
dwelling place of redeemed and glorified mankind. &#8220;And I saw a new
heaven and a new earth&#8221; (Rev. xxi:1). &#8220;And He that sat upon the
throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And He said unto me, Write:
for these words are true and faithful&#8221; (Rev. xxi:5). &#8220;And there
shall be <b>no more curse</b>; but the throne of God and of the Lamb
shall be in it; and His servants shall serve Him. And they shall see His
face; and His Name shall be in their foreheads. And there shall be no
night there; and they need no candle, neither light of the sun; for the
Lord God giveth them light; and they shall reign forever and ever&#8221;
(Rev. xxii:3-5).</p>

<p>This will be the ultimate result of the blessed Work of Christ. His
past work is finished. Soon His present Work may end and then His
future, kingly work begins, when He comes the second time.</p>

<center><h3><b>&#8220;Amen. Even so, come, Lord
Jesus.&#8221;</b></h3></center>
